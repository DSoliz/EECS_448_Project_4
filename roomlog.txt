<p>This: This</p><p>Alrighty Then: What is up?</p><p>dwendt: not much</p><p>Alrighty Then: Good to hear</p><p>mbechtel: Test, can anyone see this message?</p><p>Diego: Hey guys?</p><p>Diego: This is F U C K I N G " " A W E S O M E ! !</p><p>Diego: Not sure if it is a feature or a bug but we can inject html code inside the input box and actually have it run on the chat box</p><p>Diego: <button type="button">Click Me!</button></p><p>Diego: We might have to change this or limit the type of stuff the users can do with this.</p><p>mbechtel: Let's call it a feature, cause it looks kinda cool</p><p>Diego: Yea right?</p><p>Diego: We could implement like a voting system using html code, (for next project)</p><p>Diego: I hope this works</p><p>Diego: ok embeding youtube is weird</p><p>mbechtel: Yes, we need to put that on the product backlog</p><p>Diego: please erase that part on the txt file hehe</p><p>Diego: Another feature, live moderation LOL</p><p>mbechtel: That could go wrong in so many ways, which is why we need to make that happen.</p><p>Diego: Also, do when I close the tab does my username get deleted?</p><p>mbechtel: Not from the database, that only happens when you hit the leave button below</p><p>Diego: Got it</p><p>mbechtel: Also, I added the HTML embed and mod privilege ideas to the backlog, is there anything else we could add?</p><p>Diego: Mmmmm...</p><p>Diego: Media sharing perhaps</p><p>Diego: Although that could be pretty hard now that I think about it</p><p>Diego: Oh the most important, to hit enter to send message haha</p><p>mbechtel: I put those both on the backlog. Give me a sec I'll push my changes to your Github.</p><p>Diego: Ok</p><p>Diego: It's funny how we are now using our own product. Even if he is not impressed I'd say this is good enough.</p><p>mbechtel: We should show this log during our presentation as a proof of concept.</p><p>Diego: Sure that be great</p><p>Diego: I'll figure out how to change styles between desktop and mobile devices after 448 lab</p><p>Diego: And also how to send a message without having a page reload</p><p>mbechtel: Yea, there are definitely things we could do for Project 4 so we probably won't have to worry about that.</p><p>Diego: For now I think if we add more style to what we have for now we can stand strong.</p><p>mbechtel: Do you know when Connor's lab ends? He'd probably have the best idea style-wise of what to do.</p><p>Diego: I don't know where he is, I'm on lab right now I don't see him.</p><p>Diego: We need timestamps too</p><p>Diego: Also I added a CSS file for the chat room</p><p>Diego: The page should look much prettier now</p><p>mbechtel: Very much so</p><p>mbechtel: Should I also apply the CSS file to the pre chat room?</p><p>Diego: Not for now i think</p><p>Diego: ok I pushed an even more prettier css</p><p>mbechtel: K, if anything we could leave that for project 4</p><p>Diego: is this .php within the repository you work in? So that when I do a change to my repo, when you pull it it updates here?</p><p>mbechtel: No, I have to pull if from your repo then copy the changes/files to my public_html folder.</p><p>mbechtel: pull it*</p><p>dwendt: not much</p><p>Diego: oh</p><p>Diego: btw im at linux labs</p><p>Diego: I just pushed more style into the git hub</p><p>mbechtel: Is this what it's supposed to look like?</p><p>mbechtel: Is this what it's supposed to look like?</p><p>Diego: Dayum now this is more like it =D</p><p>mbechtel: Is this what it's supposed to look like?</p><p>mbechtel: There's a bug, refreshing the page reposts the last message typed.</p><p>Diego: That is because of the post method</p><p>Diego: Reloading will send the last POST sent (referring to method="POST")</p><p>Diego: We can try to fix it but now we will have to rely that our users dont reload the page manually and don't select resubmit form</p><p>: Am I still Diego?</p><p>dwendt: not much</p><p>mbechtel: Testing to see if chat works on a mobile device.</p><p>mbechtel: It does.</p><p>Cwelch: Wow this looks amazing props on the design</p><p>Cwelch: Wow this looks amazing props on the design</
